		Zachary Bibb for starters was born in Winston Salem, North Carolina on May 8th, 1997. He lived in Mount Airy, North Carolina for about one year. His family moved to Warner Robins, Georgia due to his father's new job in Macon, Georgia. He went to elementary school at Christ United Methodist Church in Warner Robins. For middle school he attended Huntington Middle School and for high school he went to Warner Robins High School.

		Zac grew up an avid <b>NC State</b> athletics fan. This love for everything <b>NC State</b> sprouted from his dad also being a passionate <b>NC State</b> alumni. With this love for <b>NC State</b>, Zac always wanted to go there. This however was never really an option for him. Zac knew of the HOPE Scholorship and how logical it was for him to stay in state for college. This lead Zac to apply for <b>UGA</b>.
	</center></p>
	<p><center>
		He was denied in the spring of 2015. His application was not looked at because the teacher recommendation did not get sent in on time. This was his own fault. He then applied and was immediately accepted to attend <b>Georgia Southern</b> starting in the fall of 2015. Zac had no clue what he wanted to study in college. He came into <b>Georgia Southern</b> with 20 credit hours of AP credit. With this head start he decided he could finish up all of his core classes in about 2 semesters.

		Zac cruised through his first semester of college accumulating a 3.92 GPA. He got a "B" in a one credit hour environmental biology lab. After seeing this success, Zac decided he would give going to <b>UGA</b> a second chance. He applied in early March and was accepted in late April. Zac proceeded to finish his career at <b>Georgia Southern</b> with an accumulated GPA of 3.96 after finishing spring classes with a 4.0 taking 14 credit hours.

		Zac signed up and went to Fall 2016 transfer orientation on June 10th, 2016. This was his first time visiting the <b>UGA</b> campus. The first thing he noticed was the difference in campus size between <b>GSU</b> and <b>UGA</b>. <b>Georgia Southern's</b> campus is very linear. Every building is on one strip called "The Pedestrian". This is very unlike <b>UGA</b>. Another major difference was the amount of students. There is about a 10 to 12 thousand difference between the schools. Zac was ready to embrace these changes and work to become the best Dawg he could be.
